      <description>It took me sometime to understand how to use hugo and the site that helped me the most, besides my good friend Erik Zaadi (Check out his amazing blog at http://erikzaadi.com/), was this site: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-hugo-a-static-site-generator-on-ubuntu-14-04
I totally recommend it in case you are thinking of using Hugo</description>

      <title>IllegalAccessError - Using URLClassLoader and package private methods</title>

      <description>When working with URLClassLoader, one of the things we need to watch for, is the &amp;lsquo;run-time packages&amp;rsquo;. According to Java spec, a class is determined by it&amp;rsquo;s binary name and it&amp;rsquo;s class loader. Meaning, the class &amp;lsquo;signature&amp;rsquo; is the binary name and the class loader used to load it.
Once loaded, each class belongs to a single run-time package.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3
 At run time, a class or interface is determined not by its name alone, but by a pair: its binary name and its defining class loader.</description>

      <description>Hi there,
This is my first post using Github as a place to host my blog. Till now I&amp;rsquo;ve been hosting it using Blogger, but, Blogger is missing a main feature I need which is code blocks.
So, after getting a lot of recommendations from a friend about Hugo (See at https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) I&amp;rsquo;ve switched.</description>
