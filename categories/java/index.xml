      <description>Scenario:
I needed a way to track down the path my program was going through and also, in each method that was tracked, to know the methods status (Passed or failed) and other meta data on the method&amp;hellip;
First problem - How to track down the path of all the method?
I&amp;rsquo;ve used the example from [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/reflection/proxy.html ]() to have a pre / post method.
Second problem - How to get the meta data of the method?</description>

      <title>IllegalAccessError - Using URLClassLoader and package private methods</title>

      <description>When working with URLClassLoader, one of the things we need to watch for, is the &amp;lsquo;run-time packages&amp;rsquo;. According to Java spec, a class is determined by it&amp;rsquo;s binary name and it&amp;rsquo;s class loader. Meaning, the class &amp;lsquo;signature&amp;rsquo; is the binary name and the class loader used to load it.
Once loaded, each class belongs to a single run-time package.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3
 At run time, a class or interface is determined not by its name alone, but by a pair: its binary name and its defining class loader.</description>
